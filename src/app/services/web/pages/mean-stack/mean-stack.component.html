                        MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL document-oriented database program that uses
                        JSON-like documents with optional schemas. It was created to handle the large volumes of
                        data that modern applications generate, and provides features like automatic sharding and
                        replication to ensure scalability and availability. MongoDB uses a flexible document model
                        to store data, making it easy to represent complex hierarchical relationships. It also
                        provides advanced querying and indexing capabilities to support fast and efficient data
                        retrieval. MongoDB is used by many organizations, including startups and large enterprises,
